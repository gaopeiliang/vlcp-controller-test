Feature: l3switch external network
    Scenario: l3switch external mode
        Given create vlan physicalnetwork "e8e386fa"
        and create physicalport "bridge" "e8e386fa"
        and create logicalnetwork "17f3d580" "e8e386fa"
        and create external subnet "257af374","17f3d580","172.100.200.0/24" "172.100.200.253"

        and create vxlan physicalnetwork "edac6346"
        and create physicalport "vxlan0" "edac6346"
        and create logicalnetwork "1fd3954a" "edac6346"
        and create subnet "236fae62","1fd3954a","172.100.101.0/24" "172.100.101.1"
        and create l3 logicalport "d13f31a2" "1fd3954a" "236fae62" "76:b8:46:68:eb:ac" "172.100.101.2"
        and ovs add interface "veth1" "d13f31a2" "host1" "76:b8:46:68:eb:ac"
        and dhcp get ip "host1" "veth1"
        and check get ip "host1" "veth1" "172.100.101.2"

        and create router "c707aa9c"
        and add router interface "c707aa9c" "257af374"
        and add router interface "c707aa9c" "236fae62"
        and config bridge as external "172.100.101.0/24" gateway "172.100.200.253"

        and create l3 logicalport "963008a6" "1fd3954a" "236fae62" "be:cf:72:24:77:b0" "172.100.101.3"
        and ovs add interface "veth1" "963008a6" "host2" "be:cf:72:24:77:b0"
        and dhcp get ip "host2" "veth1"
        and check get ip "host1" "veth1" "172.100.101.2"

        then check l3 logicalport ping address "host1" "veth1" "172.100.101.1"
        and check l3 logicalport ping address "host1" "veth1" "172.100.200.253"
        and check l3 logicalport ping address "host2" "veth1" "172.100.101.1"
        and check l3 logicalport ping address "host2" "veth1" "172.100.200.253"
